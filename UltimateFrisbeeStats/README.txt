The goal of this project is to creat an application that will work on android devices especially phones that will allow a person to take Ultimate Frisbee stats on the sidelines.

Sence my plan is to send this app to ultimate players that are not nessicarily android developers I will post a few usefull links below:
Getting started with android development in eclipse:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html

The uml editor I intend to use:

I will attempt to leave current or fairly current copies of the uml diagram in PDF format in with the uml produced by UMLet, this is the only compiled binary I intend to have in the repository incase people do not wish to install UMLet.
